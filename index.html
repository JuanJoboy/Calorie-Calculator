    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Calorie Calculator app (the "Application") for mobile devices, created by Ichor Labs (the "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <strong>No Personal Data Collection</strong>
    <p>The Application does not require any user account creation, sign-in, or registration. The Service Provider does not collect, store, or have access to any personal information or data entered into the Application. All user data, including macro calculations or calorie calculations, is stored locally on your device and remains under your exclusive control.</p>

    <strong>External Links</strong>
    <p>The Application may contain links to external websites for informational purposes. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by the Service Provider. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
    <p>The Application utilizes Google Play Services, which may collect information used to identify you (such as your IP address or device identifiers) to facilitate app functionality and basic analytics. You can find their policy here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Data Retention & Deletion</strong>
    <p>Since the Service Provider does not collect or store your data on external servers, there is no user data to delete from our records. To delete all data associated with the Application, you can clear the Application's cache/data via your device settings or uninstall the Application.</p>

    <strong>Security</strong>
    <p>The Service Provider values your trust. While your data is stored locally on your device, we recommend maintaining device security (such as screen locks) to protect your information if you deem it sensitive.</p>

    <strong>Changes</strong>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
    
    <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2026-02-20</p>
    
    <strong>Your Consent</strong>
    <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p>
